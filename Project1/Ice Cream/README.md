## Overview
This demo showcases the creation of a procedural ice cream cone using Houdini's powerful procedural modeling tools. The cone is generated by shaping a grid into a waffle pattern, while the ice cream scoops are made with different characteristics, including a chocolate drizzle, sugar sprinkles, and embedded fruit pieces with a bitten effect. Additionally, the project features a dynamic system for procedurally placing a varying number of scoops on the cone, ensuring a balanced and natural arrangement. A decorative biscuit stick is also added to enhance the visual appeal.

## Technical Details
- **Software:** Houdini
- **Techniques:** Procedural modeling, VDB operations, Copy to Points, VEX scripting
- **Key Features:**
  - Procedural waffle cone with irregular damage simulation
  - Three distinct ice cream scoop styles: chocolate drizzle, sugar sprinkles, and embedded fruit pieces with a bitten effect
  - Dynamic parameter controls for cone radius and number of scoops, with automatic adjustments to scoop size and positioning
  - Procedural placement of varying numbers of ice cream scoops on the cone
  - Decorative biscuit stick with procedural striped pattern

## Implementation Details

### Waffle Cone
- **Base Shape:** Created by extruding a grid with a waffle pattern.
- **Waffle Texture:** Achieved by scattering points on the grid and using `copytopoints` to add small varying-sized particles.
- **Cone Assembly:** The waffle and particles are combined using VDB to simulate slight irregularities and minor damage.
- **Final Shape:** The assembled waffle is then shaped into a cone using `bend` and `lineartaper`.

### Ice Cream Scoops
- **Base Shape:** A deformed sphere created with `mountain` for an uneven, natural surface. Three variations are made:
  
  1. **Chocolate Drizzle:**
     - Selected the upper part of the sphere using normal direction and assigned weights.
     - Applied blur and remap operations on the weights, then used these to control `pscale` with added noise.
     - Converted particles to VDB for final shaping, and returned to geometry.

  2. **Sugar Sprinkles:**
     - Selected the upper part of the sphere and scattered points.
     - Randomized attributes such as scale, orientation, and color (`Cd`).
     - Copied a sugar sprinkle model (created with `tube`) to the scattered points using `copytopoints`.

  3. **Fruit Pieces with a Bite:**
     - Created a "bitten" effect using boolean operations between another sphere and the ice cream.
     - Used `pointsfromvolume` to generate points within the volume, then randomized scale and orientation.
     - Copied fruit piece models (created with `box`) to the points and merged them with the ice cream.

### Decorative Biscuit Stick
- **Base Shape:** Started with a `tube` and used VEX to select alternating columns, assigning different colors to create a striped effect.

## Dynamic Parameters
- **Cone Radius:** Controls the cone's size, which the scoop size automatically adjusts with.
- **Number of Scoops:** Controls the number of ice cream scoops, which the scoop positions dynamically adjusts with.

## Dynamic Parameters
- **Cone Radius:** Controls the size of the cone, which the scoop size automatically adjusts with.
- **Number of Scoops:** Controls the number of ice cream scoops, with the scoop positions dynamically adjusting accordingly.

## Challenges and Solutions
The main challenge in this demo was to procedurally place a varying number of ice cream scoops on the cone logically. 

To address this, I first defined a general region for the scoop centers using a sphere, which was then converted to a volume with `isooffset` node. I scattered points within this volume, representing the potential positions for the scoops. Next, using an `attribwrangle` with VEX, I adjusted the positions of these points to create a spiraling upward distribution, with gradually decreasing radius. Each point was then assigned a `geom_index` to match with the different ice cream scoop geometries. This allowed the `copytopoints` operation to accurately place each scoop at its designated position, ensuring a balanced and natural arrangement.

## Future Improvements
Future enhancements could include more variations in the ice cream types, additional decorations, and further refinement of the procedural controls for even more customization.

## Summary
This demo highlights my ability to combine procedural techniques with creative design in Houdini, producing a visually appealing and highly customizable model.
